      <description>I picked up swimming practice again in the last few weeks after taking a break following my November-December lessons. Last weekend I read chapters 1-3 and the beginning of chapter 8 of “Total Immersion: The Revolutionary Way To Swim Better, Faster, and Easier”[1]. Chapters 1-3 cover more of the theory of total immersion swimming while giving encouraging advice for a novice like me. Chapter 8 is where the drills are explained in detail.</description>

      <description>Cohesion In 2013 or 2014 I was in a training class and the instructor brought up the term cohesion when describing some code the class was analyzing. This was the first time I had heard of the term cohesion being applied to a piece of code and the instructor did not spend much time on the topic. As a way of cementing the idea in my mind, I wanted to share some things I’ve read and learned regarding cohesion in software.</description>
