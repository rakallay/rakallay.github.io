# Toastmasters
In December of 2018, I joined Toastmasters\[1\] attending the chapter which conveniently meets at my workplace.  I've really enjoyed the welcoming atmosphere that Toastmasters encourages.  There are some extremely skilled and caring members(both at speaking and evaluating) who excell at encouraging growth and helping build confidence in public speaking.

I joined Toastmaster to raise my confidence in public speaking and increase my public speaking skills.  I have a good friend who started at Cerner the same day as me who did Toastmasters for several years and his skills are pretty impressive.  I also have known several respected engineers at Cerner who have done Toastmasters.  My brother did Toastmasters for several years and all this wasn't enough to compell me to do Toastmasters.  The primary reasons for me joining Toastmasters at this point in my life are:

* To gain confidence in giving the best man speach at my brother's wedding in July.
* To gain skills and confidence in giving potential talks and speeches in the workplace.
* To gain skills and confidence in potentially giving speeches for some of the fundraising activities I do outside of work.

### My experience

The thing that intrigued me about Speechcraft was the mention of actually discussing strategies for public speaking skills, which I thought had been lacking thus far in Toastmasters.  Everyone's Speechcraft schedule will be different depending on where they're at in their Toastmasters journey, but here's what my outline was:

#### Week 1
Our first week was the introductory Speechcraft session and we focused on strategies for giving effecive table topics\[2\] speaches.

#### Week 2

#### Week 3


#### Week 4

#### Week 5
In the speech this week and I had to discuss my communication style, where was identified primarily as 'supportive'.

#### Week 6
In this speech the goal was to use effective gestures.  I decided to tell a funny story of mine which allows me to easily incorporate some gestures.  I
