      <description>I picked up swimming practice again in the last few weeks after taking a break following my November-December lessons. Last weekend I read chapters 1-3 and the beginning of chapter 8 of “Total Immersion: The Revolutionary Way To Swim Better, Faster, and Easier”[1]. Chapters 1-3 cover more of the theory of total immersion swimming while giving encouraging advice for a novice like me. Chapter 8 is where the drills are explained in detail.</description>

      <title>Learning To Swim</title>

      <description>Hey! This is my first blog post about my experiences learning how to swim.
I took some swimming lessons when I was young(around 5 or 6 years old) but only took a few so I never learned how to swim when I was young. Last year I completed a 100 mile bike ride and two marathons and that piqued my interest in learning how to swim with the eventual idea of doing a triathlon or even a half or full ironman event.</description>
