      <description>Hi everyone this is my first post on this brand new blog. You may be asking yourself, why is this site called mil-e-wah-que? The answer to that question lies in the city I grew up in and the movie Wayne’s World. I grew up in the city of Milwaukee and in Wayne’s World, there is a scene where Alice Cooper gives Wayne and Garth some interesting info on Milwaukee.
I plan to use this site to blog about books I’ve read, things I’ve learned as a developer/architect and general life experiences.</description>
