      <description>Toastmasters In December of 2018, I joined Toastmasters[1] attending the chapter which conveniently meets at my workplace. I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed the welcoming atmosphere that Toastmasters encourages. There are some extremely skilled and caring members(both at speaking and evaluating) who excel at encouraging growth and helping build confidence in public speaking.
I joined Toastmaster to raise my confidence in public speaking and increase my public speaking skills. I have a good friend who started at Cerner the same day as me who did Toastmasters for several years and his skills are pretty impressive.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone this is my first post on this brand new blog. You may be asking yourself, why is this site called mil-e-wah-que? The answer to that question lies in the city I grew up in and the movie Wayne’s World. I grew up in the city of Milwaukee and in Wayne’s World, there is a scene where Alice Cooper gives Wayne and Garth some interesting info on Milwaukee.
I plan to use this site to blog about books I’ve read, things I’ve learned as a developer/architect and general life experiences.</description>
